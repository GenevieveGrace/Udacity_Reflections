    Variant code was isolated so I didn't need to sort through the existing twin
    content

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more

    Saves time -more time for skill building in other areas

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pro_manual: Only required versions saved
    Pro_Auto: Low to no risk of loss
    Con_manual: higher risk of loss
    Con_Auto: multiple versions saved -more difficult
    to sift

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    different target user

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    diff command in terminal

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
