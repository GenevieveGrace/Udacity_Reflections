When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

- for collaboration and easy access from more than one computer

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- there may be changes that aren't ready to be shared

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

- clones are copies of a repository, forks are GitHub clones, and branches are localized 
deviations from any master branch

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

- enables user to keep track of collaborative contributions (see whom did what)

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

- more in person meetings, which would make time management more difficult but perhaps
improve quality of communication 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

- When working on an experimental feature or adjustment, you have the option to take more risks while working on a branch. However, it's a simpler process to make changes on the master branch
